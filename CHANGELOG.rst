v0.11.2a
----------
* IoCs DB: now every time that the user uploads/edits a analysis session
 (weblog/netflow/ another logs),
the system will update automatically the verdicts of the rows (IoC).
First it gets all the IoC of the session,
compares with its IoC DB and update the rows' verdict. This functionality also works for non-save
session.
* every time that the user places a verdict, the domain IoC (for now) of given row is updated.
A history register is created too.
